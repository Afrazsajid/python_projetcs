# Sorting Visualizer using Pygame

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer README! In this little guide, I'll walk you through what this project is all about, how to set it up, and what exciting things are in store for its future.

## What is this?

So, you want to see how sorting algorithms work visually? This project is all about that! Using Pygame, a cool Python library for creating games and graphics, we've built a sorting visualizer. You can watch as different sorting algorithms rearrange elements in real-time on your screen. It's like magic, but with code!

## Setting Up

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the main file**: Go ahead and grab the main file from wherever it's hosted.
3. **Run `main.py`**: Open up your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you extracted the files, and run `python main.py`.

That's it! You should see the sorting visualizer window pop up, ready for action.

## How to Use

Once the visualizer is up and running, here's what you can do:

- **Press 'R' to Reset ** : Hit the 'R' key on your keyboard to REset the List
- **Press 'Enter' to Start Sorting**: Hit the 'Enter' key on your keyboard to kickstart the sorting process. Watch closely as the elements dance around and arrange themselves according to the chosen sorting algorithm.
- **Press 'Up key' to increase quantity**: Hit the 'up' key on your keyboard to increase the quantity of container
- **Press 'Down key' to increase quantity**: Hit the 'up' key on your keyboard to decrease the quantity of container
  

## Future Plans

Exciting developments are in the pipeline! Currently, the visualizer uses selection sort, but we have grand plans to expand it. Soon, you'll be able to:

- **Switch Between Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to see how they compare.
- **Adjust Order of Sorting**: Customize the order in which elements are sorted, giving you even more control and insight.

Stay tuned for these awesome updates!

## Known Issue: Not Responding During Sorting

Okay, so here's the deal: we're aware that sometimes the visualizer might freeze up while sorting. It's like when you're watching a movie and it suddenly buffers â€“ not cool. But fear not! We're on it. Our top priority is to fix this pesky issue, and we're working hard to implement generators to solve it. Stay tuned for updates!

## Get Involved

If you're as excited about this project as we are, why not get involved? Whether you're a coding wizard or just starting out, there are plenty of ways to contribute. Check out the code, suggest improvements, or even submit your own sorting algorithms! Let's make this visualizer the best it can be together.

And that's it! Thanks for checking out our Sorting Visualizer. Now go ahead, press 'R', and watch those elements sort themselves out! ðŸš€
